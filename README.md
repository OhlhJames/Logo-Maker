# Logo Maker

## Description
            
This application allows users to select a shape and select up to three characters for their logo. Additionally this application allows users to select colors for both their shape and text which adds a level of customization for users. 
                       
## Installation

users need to first install nodeJS if they haven't already as well as insuring they have installed the dependencies for this program; Inquirer and Jest.
            
## Usage
            
Users will start by running index.JS through Node. After running Node index.JS users will be asked to answer questions about their logo where they can select a shape, input a color for the shape, select up to three characters for their logo, and input a color for the text of their logo. After a user has completed this step they will either get an error message explaining why their logo could not be made or they will get a console.logged success message. If users get a console.logged success message the logo.SVG file will have been created and appended to their file system within the application. 

## Credits

For this project I used MDN to see how to program SVG files as well as a Stack Overflow thread located at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54955165/create-a-equilateral-triangle-using-svg-in-html-with-base-and-height-100px for how to create a triangle. For the javascript I used the code provided in the classes gitlab repository as a reference.
